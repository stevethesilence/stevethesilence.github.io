                            <h3>A Brief Introduction</h3>
                            <p>My name is Steven and I have been practising circus skills since 2012. I first tried it when a college friend offered a much more fun alternative to going to class. I was hooked on day 1 and now I would like to share with you why I believe you should also think about taking up circus. My aim with this website is to give you a brief insight into the basics of the circus community in Ireland including groups that meet up, props you can try and larger gatherings that happen throughout the country. If you have any questions, whether they be about my experiences or about the site, feel free to use the form at the bottom of the page and send me a question.
                            </p> 
                            <p>Circus is a skill sharing based community so at itâ€™s heart it is very social and open to new and improving jugglers as well as talented performers looking to spread their unique skill to make it a little less unique. Activities include ball juggling, hula hooping, poi, diabolo, acrobatics, plate spinning, unicycling and balloon modelling, to name but a few. In truth, just about any skill or trick involving any prop can be considered a circus skill.</p>

                        <h3>Irish Circus Groups on Facebook </h3>
                        <p> How many in the circus community begin their journey is via the circus society or club in their college or university. This provides a space to meet people with similar interests and varied skill levels, the society or club usually provides a handful of equipment which allows you to try out a variety of props to find out what suits you best and the committee and other members can go as a group to circus events outside of your college or university to meet even more people with the community such as to circus conventions
Here are a few handy social links to help you find your nearest circus meet-up. The groups are usually friendly and welcome to new people joining in, even if you do not attend the college they are affiliated with. </p>
